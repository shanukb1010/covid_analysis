# COVID-19 Analysis using Python

## Overview

This repository contains Python scripts and Jupyter Notebooks for analyzing COVID-19 data. The analysis aims to provide insights into the spread, impact, and trends of the COVID-19 pandemic using data visualization and statistical techniques.

## Features

- **Data Cleaning:** Comprehensive data cleaning to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** In-depth analysis of COVID-19 datasets to identify patterns, correlations, and key metrics.
- **Geographical Visualization:** Maps and charts to visualize the geographical spread of COVID-19 cases.
- **Time Trends:** Analyzing temporal trends to understand the evolution of the pandemic.
